        Documentation Excerpt
        <br><br>
        <em>Performed at the opening day of my solo show <a href="capture.html" style="background-color:white; color:red;">捕/Capture</a> at <a href="https://www.tanyubing.com/the-pond" target="_blank" style="background-color:white; color:red;">The Pond Gallery</a>. The performance documentation video was then edited and played back in the same space where the performance happened, on the same TV I held and its stand, playing on loop.</em>

      <p style="font-size: 14px;">
        I have provided the QR code of the scheduled Tencent meeting. The audience was invited to scan the QR code to join the meeting. As they scan the QR code, they point their phone camera at me. The only rule of the performance was that as someone pointed their camera at me, I would shoot back at them, until no one pointed their cameras at me anymore... or I would decide when to put down the TV monitor I had been been holding in my arms. It was a game of un-strangling.
        <br><br>
        The performance lasted for 44 minutes.

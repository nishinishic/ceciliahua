      <p style="font-size: 14px;">
        Captured in a non-fiction diary form, <em>Where Are You From</em> is an overdue expression and exploration of my feelings of inferiority as a “parachute kid” from China. The film explores the state of mind of China’s young generation abroad. In a world where western values dominate, coming to America at an impressionable age can make parachute kids feel ashamed of their identity, especially being a "mainland Chinese." Often times the "stuck-in-between" feeling became more acute because they are more and more accustomed to the American democratic values but also started to question many aspects of it, which makes them wonder what the unbiased views are on contemporary Chinese society and politics. Realizing their lack of understanding of their own country’s history and politics, they are put at odds in answering to the media’s critique of China and its people. This video raises questions of origin and identity to create discussion on what it means to be both a Chinese and an international citizen.

      <p style="font-size: 14px;">
        When Okunojima “disappeared” from the map due to the production of chemical weapons, the Okunojima Lighthouse remained standing and continued to observe and give its light to the world. Currently, the lighthouse stands here on Yashima, holding the history of the Yashima Genpei War in 1185. Witnessing conflicts and change, Okunojima Lighthouse stayed “out of time.”
        <br><br>
        Coming to Yashima from the outside, I bring observations of changes and conflicts from other lands as well. What is our relationship with the outside world today – other cultures, ruling powers or conflicting ideologies? How do we see; how should we enter? What to remember, or to forget? Light or shadow? Danger or safety? Dream or memory?
        <br><br>
        Between real-time obscura image and the nine-hour long digital video projection, every second is a new life. Light and shadow alternate in a three-second interval, the same pattern as the beam of light projected from the original lighthouse. We go inside this lighthouse to see again what is on the outside. We unsee the images to see again.
        <br><br>
        How I wish to become a lighthouse.

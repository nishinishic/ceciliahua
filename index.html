          I am an artist, researcher, thinker, maintainer, mediator, documentarian...

          滑惜子 is my name, or Xizi Hua on English documents; Xizi “Cecilia” Hua and Cecilia Hua at events. Pondering over generations of the romanization systems, I'm now writing my name out as hua xi zi. 
          滑/hua is a rare last name dating back to the Zhou dynasty, 惜子/xi zi means “precious child.” C* is for online identities.

          A big progression of my work has been inspired by my growing up between China and the US since the age of fifteen, 
          as well as by my studies in cinema, media, and art from American institutions, 
          experiences in photojournalism, tech labor and maintenance work in film and theater productions, 
          participation in alternative spaces and self-organized collectives, interests in underground movements and revolts ...,
          and every place we've passed by, every encounter I've spent time with...
        </p>
        <p>
          I live, think, and work between ideologies, political structures, internet envrionments that can be conflicting and exclusive of one another (specifically that between the US and China),
          but I hope to look for the simultaneous complexities and even temporary moments of lasting time, understanding in seeing, listening, thinking, feeling... 
          I continue to look for ways to “un-expose” while seeking for alternative yet sustaining methods and aesthetics to connect, to be with, and to co-exist across borders of cultures, ideologies, the firewall..., virtually and physically at the same time.

              This first video sequence ‘The Terminal Vision,’ in total of three tracks, 
              broadcasted on the SCA-1 satellite (<a href="https://www.n2yo.com/?s=58924&live=1" target="_blank" style="background-color:white; color:blue;">NORAD ID 58924</a>) in low earth orbit and was captured by the camera attached to the satellite on May 12th 2025, with the earth and space in the backdrop. 
              This is a first iteration of the network and web-based project, <em>Satellite Image Exchange</em> [<a href="https://satimg.exchange/" target="_blank" class="link" style="justify-self: center;">satimg.exchange</a>],
              collaborated with <a href="https://www.patrickoshea.art/" target="_blank" style="background-color:white; color:blue;">Patrick O'Shea</a>.
            </p>
            <p style="background-color: black; color: white; font-size: 15px;">
              The synthesized landscape was a result of generation by inverting the use of <a href="https://satimg.exchange/methodology.html" target="_blank" style="background-color: blue; color: white;">a custom AI process</a>—revealing systems of surveillance and algorithmic censorship—and extraction of geolocation metadata from a collection of our personal photographs taken with our phone.

            <p style="background-color: black; color: white; font-size: 15px;">
              This project explores planetary projections entangling between photographic captures, satellite remote sensing, machine learning, geospatial map-making, distributed networks, and digital archiving. 
              It is also to build an observation protocol that invites others to share and exchange their imagery visions, making a constantly evolving satellite image body public to all: “What is the world you would like us to see?” Each participation becomes reflective of each other’s geopolitical positions and infrastructural contexts.

              the idea of this project emerged from my research in the distributed web and our growing relationship with images--from the act of capturing, scanning, to uploading, downloading--can (the proof of) images allow us to connect more?

            What really interests me about the use of AI in image production nowadays, as much as it's about generating Midjourney fantasies and Sora simulative time or the replacement in reimagining scenes, characters, movements, 
            and definitely beyond seeing <em>with</em> photographic machines or making images utilizing digital softwares/visual coding mechanisms,
            it is more about the process where we could think with the intellect of the machines while envisioning our worlds simultaneously. <em>Envisioning with the AI</em> is probably about envisioning with the changing systems around us.
            <br><br>Hence, what are you seeing when you're thinking? 
            <br><br>How are we seeing differently in our very different ways of thinking? 
            <br><br>How can we share the different visions as we see, think, and feel very differently?

          <p style="font-size:15px;">
            In our everyday interactions with the machines, more and more we <em>have to</em> engage with both the situated physical infrastructure while being taken into the virtual, 
            such as when scanning local QR codes, tapping for a NFC (Near Field Communication) application... (the physical + virtual experiences are apparent and life-changing in China as we live off QR-code payments, city-bike infrastructures, and portable power-bank stations...)
            <br><br>The experience is both of displacement and grounding at the same time.
            With the virtual portal privilege, we're taken to the virtual machines of the imaginations, while it is humbling to be aware of the physical reality we're still standing on our foot upon.
